Mastery of the beautiful and creative movement that makes Capoeira the most graceful and enchanting way to get and stay in shape requires a lot of preparation before class even starts. This is why I often emphasize that we "live" Capoeira, we do not "do" it like people do swimming or cycling. These activities end after an hour or so, but Capoeira doesn't. Capoeira is a lifestyle. To optimize our ability to move in the artistic and creative ways Capoeira demands of us, we have to make some important changes to our lifestyle. Here are six basic ways to radically optimize your mastery of moves that you will learn and train in class.

	      <h5>Attitude</h5><hr />
              <p style="font-size:12px">
Radical improvement requires radical change. The most radical change starts in the mind beginning with your attitude. Capoeira requires a "can do" attitude. Your teachers will move in ways you cannot fathom when you attend a class for the first time. Don't be discouraged when you don't understand how to move. Since society places heavy emphasis on learning from books, your initial attempts to replicate a move will fail. However, it is only because those "muscles" in the brain have never been exercised. By practicing Capoeira you are embarking upon a voyage to learn to move in ways that you had never thought of before.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:12px">
Being open-minded, inquisitive / observant, and patient are changes in attitude that we all need to embrace in order to rapidly progress in our mastery of Capoeira movement. When the teacher or senior student says "now it is time to walk on our hands", be open to trying it for the first time. Observe what is being done, ask questions, and be patient with yourself if you don't walk on your hands perfectly the first time.

	      <h5>Discipline</h5><hr />
              <p style="font-size:12px">
Disciple, discipline, discipline. That is why Capoeira is a martial art. All martial arts require discipline. Discipline requires us to go to class and train even when we don't feel like it. Discipline means getting up and dragging yourself to class when it is cold and dark outside.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:12px">
Don't despair if you are not a disciplined person by nature. The good thing about discipline is that it is a virtue that can be developed. Take it step by step and try disciplining yourself with easy tasks and chores outside of class. Overtime you will be able to discipline yourself more and more. Eventually, you will discipline your life and attend every class! It is no secret that those that progress fastest in our Capoeira group are the ones that have the highest rates of class attendance.
              </p>

	    <div class="span4">
	      <h5>Diet</h5><hr />
              <p style="font-size:12px">
You are what you eat. Especially, when you need to use your body to attain your movement goals. If you eat junk food, your body will rapidly deteriorate and your will not be able to achieve your Capoeira dreams.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:12px">
There is no special diet for a Capoeirista. Our bodies are all different. So we eat accordingly. However, we should at least be aware of our nutrition and active work to make sure that we are eating all the right foods to recover after fatiguing our muscles in class.

	    <div class="span4">
	      <h5>Rest</h5><hr />
              <p style="font-size:12px">
Rest is also essential to rapidly recovering between classes. We are all busy. However, please try to avoid late nights and idling your time away. Rest instead.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:12px">
Prior to attending class, try taking a 30 minute nap. It will refresh the mind and make you more alert during class. Your ability to interpret and recall what goes down will also improve.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:12px">
A rested mind is also more creative. Use this to your advantage so that you can maximize your creativity during the roda when it is time to play Capoeira and creatively integrate the movement that you have learned into your game.
              </p>
      	    </div>
	    <div class="span4">
	      <h5>Practice</h5><hr />
              <p style="font-size:12px">
Note what you learned in class, go home, and practice again at home before you forget.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:12px">
The more unfamiliar you are with a movement, the more likely you are to forget it. Try to practice until mastery. Mastery requires doing movement over and over until it becomes almost second nature.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:12px">
Make a friend in class and practice with them because Capoeira cannot be mastered alone. Playing Capoeira, by definition, requires two people. So partner up and practice often.
              </p>
      	    </div>
	    <div class="span4">
	      <h5>Community</h5><hr />
              <p style="font-size:12px">
Generating huge amounts of deference and respect for the community of martial artists that comprise our Capoeira group is the quickest way to develop in the other five areas outlined before. You are not the first one to be walking down the Capoeira path. The masters, teachers, and senior students that have gone before you are your most valuable resources to rapidly developing your abilities to move in Capoeira. Masters and teachers often sacrifice themselves to promote and develop Capoeira for future generations to ensure that those that come behind them can more perfectly experience the bliss of Capoeira. Consequently, they enjoy giving back and sharing. Especially when they feel that you respect their knowledge and sacrifice.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:12px">
Though advanced Capoeiristas have a keen eye, it is highly beneficial to clearly signal your respect for them. A common way to show your respect is to actively work on building your relationship with teachers and seniors. Take every opportunity to spend time with the community of Capoeiristas outside of class hours. Meet for tea or coffee. Join group functions (birthday parties, Brazilian movie nights, Capoeira video reviews, etc.) and make every effort to join rodas, sing and play music. Augmenting your Capoeira experience in this way not only improves your knowledge of Capoeira and Afro-Brazilian culture, but also indicates that you are sharing your energy and giving back to the group.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:12px">
Lastly, although you will do everything in your power to adhere to these guidelines and suggestions to radically improve, without the community there is nobody to catch you when you slip. You will slip. It is inevitable that your attitude is not what it should be, or that your discipline wanes. However, with the community you will be able to get back up more easily. Through the community everything becomes easier because we are working together to improve as a group. So give as much as you can to the community. You will get much more out of it.
